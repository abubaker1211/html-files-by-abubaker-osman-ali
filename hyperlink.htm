            <strong>Step 1</strong> <br>
            Rinse the Rice (Optional but recommended): <br>
            Place the rice in a fine-mesh sieve or bowl. <br>
            Rinse the rice under cold water, swirling it around with your hand or stirring gently. This helps remove excess starch and any debris. <br>
            Continue rinsing until the water runs clear. This step can improve the texture of the cooked rice. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Step 2</strong> <br>
            Measure the Rice and Water: <br>
            Use the ratio of 1:2 for rice to water, meaning for every cup of rice, use 2 cups of water. Adjust this ratio based on your preference for softer or firmer rice. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Step 3</strong> <br>
            Combine Rice and Water in the Saucepan: <br>
            Place the rinsed rice into the saucepan. <br>
            Add the measured water to the saucepan. If desired, add a pinch of salt for seasoning (optional). <br>
<br>
            <strong>Step 4</strong> <br>
            Bring to a Boil: <br>
            Place the saucepan on the stove over medium-high heat. <br>
            Bring the water and rice to a boil. Stir once to ensure the rice isn't sticking to the bottom. <br>
           <br> 
            <strong>Step 5</strong> <br>
            Simmer: <br>
            Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cover the saucepan with a lid. <br>
            Let the rice simmer for about 15-20 minutes. Avoid lifting the lid during this time to ensure even cooking and to retain steam. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Step 6</strong> <br>
            Check for Doneness: <br>
            After about 15 minutes, check if the rice is tender and the water has been absorbed. If not, cover and cook for a few more minutes. Be careful not to overcook the rice. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Step 7</strong> <br>
            Fluff and Serve: <br>
            Once done, remove the saucepan from the heat. <br>
            Let the rice sit covered for a couple of minutes to steam. <br>
            Fluff the rice gently with a fork or spoon to separate the grains. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Step 8</strong> <br>
            Serve: <br>
            Serve the rice as a side dish or as part of your favorite recipe. <br>
